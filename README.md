# 20180720-Advanced-Callsigns
Available Amateur Radio Advanced Callsigns (M0XXX) as of 20th July, 2018

This is a list of available UK Advanced Amateur Radio Callsigns, as of the evening of 20th July, 2018.

I did a quick and dirty scrape of the OFCOM availability checker (i.e. I did a loop to check every callsign between M0AAA and M0ZZZ).

The files here are in various formats - there is the raw output of the web service, the raw output of the available callsigns, and a cleaned up list of the available callsigns.

Things to keep in mind - this list will be out of date as soon as somebody else has applied for their callsign. It may even have gone out of date in the time it took me to scrape things (I attempted to be kind to the OFCOM server and did it single-threaded, with a half second sleep between calls). In fact, I can guarantee that it has, because I've chosen my callsign from this list, and haven't gone back to edit the file. I'm the worst ;-)
